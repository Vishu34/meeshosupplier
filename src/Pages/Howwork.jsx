          <div class="reghead2">What Is A Catalog?</div>
          <div class="regcontent1">
            A catalog is basically the list of products that you want to sell.
            You can upload a single catalog or you can upload catalogs in bulk
            using a csv (excel) file. Within each catalog, you can have a
            minimum of 1 product and a maximum of 9 products of the same
            category that you want to sell.
          </div>
          <div class="regcontent1">
            For example, you want to sell 6 sarees, then within the same
            catalog, you can upload all the 6 products together. But if you want
            to sell 1 saree and 1 kurta, you will have to upload a different
            catalog for each category.
          </div>
          <div class="reghead2">how to upload a catalog?</div>
          <div class="regcontent1">
            It is now very easy to upload single catalogs or bulk catalogs on
            Meesho! The product catalog gets live post 72 hours from the time of
            upload.
          </div>
          <div class="regcontent1">
            While uploading a catalog, you will have to select a category first
            and then upload the product images. Uploading more than one image
            for your product is recommended to give the customers a better view
            of your product. The detailed image guidelines will be provided in
            the Meesho Supplier panel. For each product, you will have to then
            fill in details like the Price, GST, etc.
          </div>
          <div class="regcontent1">
            It is recommended that you create a catalog with at least 3-4
            products to increase the chances of getting an order. We also
            recommend uploading at least 5-7 catalogs in the first few days to
            get better visibility.
